# Design Patterns   
## Examples of common Design Patterns in Java

### Pattern Categories: Structural, Creational, Behavioral
1. **Structural Patterns**
   1. Adaptor
      * Simple, easy to implement solution
      * Integration with legacy code
      * Can provide multiple adaptors
   2. Bridge
      * Designed upfront for uncertainty and change
      * Can be more complex to implement
      * Provides flexibility
      * More than just composition and Object Oriented principles 
   3. Composite
      * Generalizes a hierarchical structure
      * Can simplify things too much, rely on runtime behavior checks
      * Easier for clients to use
      * Composite != Composition
   5. Decorator
      * Original object stays the same
      * Unique way to add functionality
      * Often confused with simple inheritance, but does not modify the base object
      * Can be more complex for clients
   6. Facade
      * Simplifies client interface
      * Easy pattern to implement
      * Commonly used as a refactoring pattern
